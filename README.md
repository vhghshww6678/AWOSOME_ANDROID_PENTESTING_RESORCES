# AWOSOME_ANDROID_PENTESTING_RESORCES

INDRODUCTION:

Android pentesting, also known as Android penetration testing, is the process of evaluating the security of Android-based mobile applications and devices. This type of testing is carried out to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the security controls of Android systems.
Android pentesting is a critical part of the mobile application development process, as it helps to identify and remediate security issues before an application is deployed to the public. It involves testing the application's security controls and features, analyzing its source code, and examining its network traffic and data storage mechanisms.

1.Android pentesting typically involves the following steps:
2.Reconnaissance: This involves identifying the target application or device and gathering information about it.
3.Vulnerability scanning: This involves using automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities in the application or device.
4.Manual testing: This involves manually testing the application or device to identify security issues that may have been missed by automated tools.
5.Exploitation: This involves attempting to exploit any vulnerabilities that have been identified in order to gain access to the system.
6.Reporting: This involves documenting the findings of the pentesting process and providing recommendations for remediation.

Some common vulnerabilities that may be identified during Android pentesting include insecure data storage, weak authentication mechanisms, and insecure communication channels.
Overall, Android pentesting is an essential process that helps to ensure the security and integrity of Android-based mobile applications and devices. It should be carried out by experienced professionals with a deep understanding of mobile application security and the tools and techniques used in the process.

Android OWASP TOP 10 Overview

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) is a non-profit organization focused on improving software security. The OWASP Top 10 is a list of the most critical web application security risks, and it is updated periodically to reflect new threats and vulnerabilities. The OWASP Top 10 for mobile applications is a similar list that focuses on the security risks specifically associated with mobile applications.

The OWASP Top 10 for mobile applications is a list of the most critical mobile application security risks, and it includes the following:

1.Improper Platform Usage: This risk category covers issues related to the insecure use of the Android platform and its features, such as failing to properly implement security controls or not using secure storage options for sensitive data.

2.Insecure Data Storage: This risk category refers to data that is not properly secured and can be accessed by attackers. Examples include storing data in an unencrypted format or using an easily guessable encryption key.

3.Insecure Communication: This risk category covers issues related to insecure communication channels, such as using an unencrypted HTTP connection or using weak encryption methods.

4.Insecure Authentication: This risk category covers issues related to authentication and authorization, such as weak password policies or failing to implement multi-factor authentication.

5.Insufficient Cryptography: This risk category refers to issues related to cryptography, such as using weak encryption methods or failing to protect sensitive data during transmission.

6.Insecure Authorization: This risk category covers issues related to authorization, such as failing to implement proper access controls or not properly validating user permissions.

7.Client Code Quality: This risk category covers issues related to the quality of client-side code, such as failing to properly validate user input or using insecure coding practices.

8.Code Tampering: This risk category covers issues related to code tampering, such as reverse engineering the application code or modifying it to bypass security controls.

9.Reverse Engineering: This risk category covers issues related to reverse engineering the application, such as analyzing the application code to identify vulnerabilities or extract sensitive data.

10.Extraneous Functionality: This risk category covers issues related to unnecessary or unused functionality in the application, which can increase the attack surface and create additional security risks.

It is important for developers and security professionals to be aware of the OWASP Top 10 for mobile applications and to take steps to address the risks outlined in the list. This can help to ensure that mobile applications are developed and deployed with appropriate security controls and protections.
