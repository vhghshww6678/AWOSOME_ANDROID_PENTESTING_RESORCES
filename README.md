Android Application Pentesting Methodology:

The methodology for Android mobile app pentesting involves a series of steps to identify security vulnerabilities in Android applications. Here is an overview of the key steps in the process:

1.Information gathering: This involves gathering information about the mobile application, such as the version number, the app permissions, the supported operating systems, and any known vulnerabilities. This information can be obtained through app store listings, user documentation, or other publicly available sources.

2.Threat modeling: This involves identifying the potential threats to the application and determining the level of risk associated with each threat. This process can be done through brainstorming sessions, reviewing similar apps or existing vulnerabilities, and mapping out the app's data flow.

3.Static analysis: This involves analyzing the application's source code for potential vulnerabilities, such as hard-coded passwords or sensitive data being sent over unencrypted channels. Static analysis can be done using tools such as MobSF, QARK or AndroBugs.

4.Dynamic analysis: This involves analyzing the application's behavior when it is running, such as how it handles user input or communicates with external servers. Dynamic analysis can be done using tools such as Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP or AppUse.

5.Authentication and authorization testing: This involves testing the authentication and authorization mechanisms of the application to determine whether they can be bypassed or exploited. This can be done by manipulating HTTP requests, or through tools like Frida or Xposed.

6.Network traffic analysis: This involves analyzing the traffic between the mobile application and the server to determine if sensitive data is being transmitted in clear-text or if the server is vulnerable to injection attacks. This can be done using tools like Wireshark or tPacketCapture.

7.Code review: This involves reviewing the code of the application to identify vulnerabilities that may have been missed by the previous steps. This can be done manually or through the use of automated tools.

8.Reporting: This involves documenting the findings of the pentesting process and providing recommendations for remediation. The report should include the severity of the vulnerabilities, the likelihood of them being exploited, and suggested remediation steps.

Overall, the methodology for Android mobile app pentesting is a rigorous process that requires a strong understanding of mobile application security and the tools and techniques used in the process.
